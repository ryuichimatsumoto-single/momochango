If it comes summer in japan, it is too hot and too humid.  
I wanted to know my room temperture.  
I kitted and programmed Raspberry Pi and DHT11.

she closed her life about 16 years in 2025.7.20.  
I remember her eating delicious food, sleeping or walking with.
she always angered if I went out.   
but I went back to home,she barked welcoming me.
